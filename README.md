# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning using Scikit Learn
In the following project I have compared the two most commonly used algorithms or models in Classification problems namely KNN model and
Logistic Regression model
Furthur even for the Knn model, since it accepts k (a number), the most optimal k value was calculated and was furthur compared with the accuracy of 
the LR model.
Matplot library was used to visualize the accuracy obtained or the variation in the accuracy.
Pandas was used to graphically show the distribution of the data and to find the best curve that fits the model.
I have furthur given a detailed explanation of the various steps, what the expected output should look like on successful compilation and execution
